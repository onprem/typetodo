# TypeTodo

A basic todo app I wrote to practice TypeScript

Demo: [https://typetodo.now.sh](https://typetodo.now.sh)

## Usage

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

We use `yarn` as package manager.

- Run `yarn install` to install required dependencies.
- Run `yarn start` to run a development server.
- Run `yarn build` to generate production build. You would need to deploy the `build` folder using a web server.
